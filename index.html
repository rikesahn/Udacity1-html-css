        <h2>Preliminary remarks about learning how to code</h2>
        <div>
            <p>When learning a new skill, thus going from novice to expert, you will go through several stages:
            </p>
            <ol class="a">
                <li>ignorance</li>
                <li>awareness</li>
                <li>ability</li>
                <li>fluency</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Getting from ignorance to awareness and ability takes minutes and days. Getting from ability to fluency
                might take years. Thus, it's important to have strategies to prevent frustration from turning into
                disappointment and demotivation:</p>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>ask for help (Google, online forums,...)</li>
                <li>take a break</li>
                <li>just keep on going, accept a temporary lack of complete understanding</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="space">
        <h2>5 ways of thinking that programmers need</h2>
        <div>
            <ol class="a">
                <li>procedural thinking: Instructions that a computer can follow much faster than humans</li>
                <li>abstract thinking: finding generality amongst seemingly different things</li>
                <li>systematic debugging:
                    <ol class="b">
                        <li>Collect evidence</li>
                        <li>generate theories</li>
                        <li>test those theories</li>
                        <li>fix problem</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>technological empathy: Ability to understand how computers work. Computers are machines. But they
                    cannot deal with ambiguous, context-related info ( at least not yet)</li>
                <li>systems thinking: Break down a big problem into smaller pieces</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Lesson 1: Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
            <div>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li>the internet is the world's largest <b>computer network</b></li>
                    <li>it consists of servers that contain <b>HTML</b> documents</li>
                    <li>you can access and display these files by using a program called <b>browser</b></li>
                    <li><b>Hyperlinks</b> connect to other documents</li>
                    <li>the main protocol of the web is called <b>http</b> and is used by servers to communicate with each other an with your browser</li>
                    <li>HTML documentation including tags can be looked up <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">here</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="space">
        <h2>Lesson 2: creating a structured document</h2>
        <div> The different files that compose a website are comparable to the components of a house:
            <ul class="a">
                <li>HTML files are like the different rooms</li>
                <li>CSS files are like the style (colors, materials used,...)</li>
                <li>JavaScript files are interactive components, similar to the TV remote</li>
                <li>There are rules for how these structures can interact</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>HTML structure</h3>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>HTML sites are built in a tree-like structure that is branching out</li>
                <li>The elements in the tree are the HTML tags</li>
                <li>Not all elements of the page's html-structure are visible in the browser</li>
                <li>All elements are rectangular / box-shaped</li>
                <li>this "boxified" design makes it easy to rearrange content quickly</li>
                <li>"class attributes" are like labels on boxes that categorize them</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Interplay of HTML, CSS and DOM</h3>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create webpages and control
                    their structure</li>
                <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting
                    of a document written in a markup language</li>
                <li>DOM (document object model) refers to the tree-like structure of a page. It's a cross-platform
                    and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and
                    other markup languages)</li>
            </ul>
